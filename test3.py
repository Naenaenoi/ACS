# Intended flow: Equation is entered, equation is iterated through until the program encounters
# a number, the number in front of the variable is considered an element and passed to the element
# variable, the program continues until it encounters a carrot symbol, the area after 
# the carrot symbol and before the next + or - sign is then considered an exponent, the area
# between the beginning of the equation and the exponent is considered a term and is passed to the 
# term variable. All of this is done while the elements in the equation list are removed from the
# list in order to work with the sp.diff() function.
